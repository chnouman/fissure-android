Privacy Policy for Fissure
====

Fissure collects **no** data from its users. The Google Play store requires a Privacy Policy because this app requires sensitive permissions such as the camera (although in Android 6, this permission is not granted by default).

## User Data

**No** user data, nor _any_ data, is extracted by this app and **no** servers collect data on the users.

## Log Files

**No** log files are collected. The Google Play store does allow sending crash reports, but these are anonymous and require explicit actions from the user.

## Third Party

**No** third parties are involved.

## Cookies

**No** cookies are involved whatsoever.

## Consent

By using this app, you will have no data collected whatsoever.
